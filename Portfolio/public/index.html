            Hello! I am William Hawkins, a current sophomore at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I plan on
            double majoring in Computer Science and Math with minors in Spanish and Artificial Intelligence.
            On campus, I am part of the varsity Swim Team and am a member of Triangle Fraternity. In my free
            time, I enjoy watching sports, playing video games, and listening to music. Last summer, I interned
            at Zotec Partners, a software company that works in the healthcare industry. As part of the Patient
            Experience team, I was able to gain valuable insights into the day-to-day business of software
            companies and their interactions with customers.
