                <p> For the final project in CSSE220 - Object-Oriented Software Development, I designed an
                    evolution simulator that modeled the evolution of the population. This population consisted
                    of chromosomes, each of which was composed of genes. The genes were represented as bits -
                    either a 0 or a 1 - which defined the specific trait. I implemented multiple crossover and
                    mutation rules in order to study how different evolution processes affected the final 
                    population. Finally, I added a 3rd "switch" gene which could be either a 0 or a 1. This 
                    component proved especially difficult, as the crossover and mutation rules had to be 
                    significantly upgraded to account for a 3rd gene.

                <p>
                    In CSSE120 - Intro to Software Development I was tasked to use the PyGame Library in Python
                    to create an arcade game. I chose to reconstruct Brick Breaker, the classic arcade game, with
                    a couple additional features. In addition to the necessary components of the ball bouncing around
                    and destroying bricks, I also implemented a timing system to track several game properties, such
                    as powerups.
